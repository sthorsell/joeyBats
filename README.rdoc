JoeyBats is a Ruby on Rails application that allows keeping track of who is taken at a fantasy baseball auction. It is also used to look at projected stats from a database of players and add notes. It is very much still in progress and there is some code cleanup that needs to be done, but it has worked succesfully to keep track of three previous fantasy baseball auctions.
